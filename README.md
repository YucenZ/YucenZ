## Hi 👋, I'm Yucen!

I’m a product designer with a background in web development. With the passion to help bridge the gap between people and technology, I developed my skill sets through design internship at Startup and build side projects. Outside of work, I enjoy making song covers, playing basketball, and taking photos of nature.
