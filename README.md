# Hi 👋, I'm Yucen!

Hi, I'm a product designer with a background in computer science. I design to help build tools that empower our daily lives. I developed my skills through interning as a product designer at [Nobul](https://nobul.com/), participating entrepreneurship programs at [Next Canada](https://www.nextcanada.com/programs-overview/), and launching a [side project](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/indify-2) on Product Hunt. 

I currently live in Toronto. When I am free, I love making [song covers](https://www.notion.so/Music-fa8f5e1f65584ae28a85c6a905a3b842) 🎤,  browsing [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/), and playing basketball 🏀.
